JavaScript Emotify helps make the web a better place, one tiny image at a time... (the original title was "this is what it sounds like when HTML cries" but Prince's lawyers sent me a C&D citing, get this, "bad taste"). Seriously though, this code turns text into "emotified" HTML. You know, like, with smileys.
